          <h1>Story</h1>

          <p>
            Timely's first publication, Marvel Comics #1 (cover dated Oct.
            1939), included the first appearance of Carl Burgos' android
            superhero the Human Torch, and the first appearances of Bill
            Everett's anti-hero Namor the Sub-Mariner, among other features. The
            issue was a great success; it and a second printing the following
            month sold a combined nearly 900,000 copies. While its contents came
            from an outside packager, Funnies, Inc., Timely had its own staff in
            place by the following year. The company's first true editor,
            writer-artist Joe Simon, teamed with artist Jack Kirby to create one
            of the first patriotically themed superheroes, Captain America, in
            Captain America Comics #1 (March 1941). It, too, proved a hit, with
            sales of nearly one million. Goodman formed Timely Comics, Inc.,
            beginning with comics cover-dated April 1941 or Spring 1941.
